<p>Little Red Riding Hood walked through the forest, happily skipping along until she met the big bad wolf.
&quot;Oh.&quot; Little Hood stopped in front of him. &quot;Hello.&quot;
&quot;Hello, indeed.&quot; The Wolf licked his lips. He wasn't exactly used to little snacks popping out of nowhere, just standing there for him to eat.
&quot;So...&quot; Little Hood brushed the hair out of her eyes. &quot;What's your name?&quot;
&quot;....Wolf. Wolf W. Wolfman.&quot; The Wolf said. Conversing with prey was a new experience.
&quot;Cool! I'm heading to my grandma's house!&quot; Little Hood said innocently.
The Wolf's ears perked up. &quot;Grandma, you say? Where does she live, by chance?&quot;
&quot;Over there, down the road!&quot; Little Hood lifted up her basket. &quot;She's ill, so I'm going to deliver all this stuff my mom made to her.&quot;
&quot;I see...&quot; The wolf suddenly hatched a plan. &quot;I just remembered I have something urgent to do, so I will have to catch you later.&quot;
The wolf trotted off. &quot;Bye Mister Wolf!&quot; Little Hood said.</p>
