Little Red Riding Hood walked closer to her 'grandma' and noticed that her face looked kinda funny.

&quot;The better to see you with, my dear.&quot;
&quot;But, grandmother, what large hands you have.&quot;
&quot;The better to hug you with.&quot;
&quot;Oh, but, grandmother, what a terrible big mouth you have.&quot;
&quot;The better to eat you with.&quot;
And as soon as the wolf said this, he leaped out of bed and swallowed up Little Hood.</p>
