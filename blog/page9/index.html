Thankfully, the huntsman, a friend of the Grandma, was near the house. He wanted to check up on the Grandma, and saw that Little Hood got swallowed up by the Wol.f
Just in the nick of time, he took his axe, and sliced the Wolf's stomach open, and out popped out Little Hood and her Grandma
&quot;Wow!&quot; Little Hood said. &quot;Someday, I want to be just like you!&quot;
The huntsman did a headpat of Little Hood's head and chuckled. &quot;Maybe someday. But you have to come to the academy to become a hunter like me.</p>
