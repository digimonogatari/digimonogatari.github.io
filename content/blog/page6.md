Little Red Riding Hood walked through the forest, happily skipping along until she met the big bad wolf.
"Oh." Little Hood stopped in front of him. "Hello."
"Hello, indeed." The Wolf licked his lips. He wasn't exactly used to little snacks popping out of nowhere, just standing there for him to eat.
"So..." Little Hood brushed the hair out of her eyes. "What's your name?"
"....Wolf. Wolf W. Wolfman." The Wolf said. Conversing with prey was a new experience.
"Cool! I'm heading to my grandma's house!" Little Hood said innocently.
The Wolf's ears perked up. "Grandma, you say? Where does she live, by chance?"
"Over there, down the road!" Little Hood lifted up her basket. "She's ill, so I'm going to deliver all this stuff my mom made to her."
"I see..." The wolf suddenly hatched a plan. "I just remembered I have something urgent to do, so I will have to catch you later."
The wolf trotted off. "Bye Mister Wolf!" Little Hood said.
